## Travel

Lake Wenatchee is about 2.5 hours from Seattle, WA. We recommend flying in to Seatac airport (SEA) and renting a car to drive over the pass.

Alternatively, Amtrak's Empire Builder line stops in Leavenworth. This train departs once a day from Seattle and Chicago (via Minneapolis and Glacier National Park). We would love to help support anybody who chooses to come by train--please let us know if you are traveling this way, and we will help you figure out logistics on the Leavenworth side.

We can help organize carpools from the airport or Seattle--more information on this will follow closer to the date.

## Lodging

There are a number cabins and houses for rent in the neighborhood of the venue on the north shore of Lake Wenatchee. Check airbnb.com or vrbo.com.  You may want to book early if you want to stay in this neighborhood. There are also options south on highway 207 that would be a short drive away. The drive around to the south side of the lake can take a while, so we recommend double checking the driving time of places you consider on Google Maps.

Leavenworth is the closest town with hotels, restaurants, and other amenities. The town can be a bit touristy. It's claim to fame is the cringeworthy, mandatory Bavarian theme on all structures downtown. If you want to be able to stay in a hotel and walk to a restaurant, you should stay here. It's about 20 miles and 25 minutes from Lake Wenatchee.

There are also campgrounds at Lake Wenatchee and a few more in the surrounding region.
