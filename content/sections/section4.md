## Things to do near Leavenworth

The central Cascades are spectacular in September! If you have extra time, we encourage you to come early or stay late to see the area. There is a ton to do and see.

September is great for hiking or mountain biking, but late for rafting and early for easy ski access.
We have put together a map of hikes of varying difficulty.

All those points have additional information--click [here](https://caltopo.com/m/A86C) or on "Open in CalTopo" in the upper right of the map to get the interactive version.
The [Washington Trails Association](https://wta.org) is a great resource for these and other hikes in Washington.
