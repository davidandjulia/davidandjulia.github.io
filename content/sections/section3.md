## Brown Family Homestead

The homestead is an outdoor wedding venue nestled in the valley of Lake Wenatchee on the eastern side of the Cascades. There will be a heated tent for dinner and dancing, but be sure to bring warm layers and lawn-appropriate footwear. Welcome dinner on September 10, and ceremony and reception on September 11, will be here.

The homestead website has written directions and some other useful musings:

### Lake Wenatchee State Park
We will have a send-off breakfast on September 12th at Lake Wenatchee State Park. This will take place at the South picnic area. The picnic shelter is between Brown's Family Homestead and Highway 2, so on the way home. Use the State Park's southern entrance--from Brown's, you will cross the Wenatchee river on 207, then turn right (west) on Cedar Brae Rd. From Highway 2, Cedar Brae comes as a left soon after Nason Creek Campground. Cross Nason Creek and continue to the park. State Parks in Washington require a Discover Pass or day pass for each vehicle, so carpooling may make sense--day passes can be purchased for $10 at the park.
