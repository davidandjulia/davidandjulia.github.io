## Brown Family Homestead

The homestead is an outdoor wedding venue nestled in the valley of Lake Wenatchee on the eastern side of the Cascades. There will be a heated tent for dinner and dancing, but be sure to bring warm layers and lawn-appropriate footware. 

The homestead website has written directions and some other useful musings:
