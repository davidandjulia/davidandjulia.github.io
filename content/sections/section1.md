## COVID

All plans are dependent on distribution of vaccines for COVID.

Given progress on this front, we expect that all older and at-risk individuals can be vaccinated before September, so we are hopeful that we can have a normal wedding.

However, we completely understand if you are still uncomfortable traveling at that time, and we will have Zoom arrangements for those who cannot make it in person.

If the return to normalcy is slower than hoped, we will keep you updated with contingencies (here and through email).
