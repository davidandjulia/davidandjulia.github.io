## COVID

UPDATE: We are hopeful that we can have a normal wedding, with the possible exception of our overseas guests being able to attend. Washington plans to remove all limits on outdoor gatherings at the end of June. The state park capacity on Sunday morning may be slightly stricter than normal, but we hope to manage with guests cycling through. If something changes regarding restrictions, we will let you know here and through email.

However, we do not expect COVID to be out of our lives. *Out of respect for the health of all our guests, we hope that everyone in attendance is vaccinated if eligible.* If you are unable to be vaccinated, we ask that you obtain a negative COVID test within 48 hours of the wedding, or refrain from attending (children excepted).
