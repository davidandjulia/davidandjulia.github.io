## We are registered at Crate & Barrel and REI

{{< big-button text="Crate & Barrel" href="https://www.crateandbarrel.com/gift-registry/david-lilien-and-julia-kelson/r6191481" >}}
{{< big-button text="REI" href="https://www.myregistry.com/rei/wedding-registry/julia-kelson-and-david-lilien-ann-arbor-mi/2632217" >}}

Note that we are moving a lot in the next six months, which is exciting but a mess if you are sending us anything! The return address on the save-the-date and invitations is good through August 13th. If you have questions about our address after that, please get in touch (mailing or shipping to David's parents' house is a safe bet for us getting something quickly without it getting lost).
